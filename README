Network Terminator

Simple WordPress plugin to bulk add terms to taxonomies across the mutisite network.

Version: 0.0.1

License: GPL2

Description:
- Alows to bulk add terms across network
- You can select what sites will be affected
- Works with custom taxonomies
- Works from any site in the network
- Features a 'test run' button to preview the results before execution

- Will not register your custom taxonomies network-wide (it's up to you!)
- Doesn't delete terms (planned soon)
- Doesn't sync (planned later)


Known issues:
	1. It will add terms to the custom taxonomy despite the fact that this taxonomy is not registered on the target site.
	Error messagge about non-existing taxonomy is therefore never displayed.
	If the taxonomy is registered later the terms are magicaly there. This could be a feature but as it is it's a bug.
	Related: global $wp_taxonomies related functions such as taxonomy_exists() or get_taxonomies() seems to doesn't work 'remotely' after switch_to_blog(). WordPress bug? My bug?
	 
	2. Sometimes it doesn't display the correct blog names when running together with WPML plugin.
	Shows current blog name instead. WPML plugin bug? Domain Mapping plugin bug? My bug?


Future releases:
	Undo button.
	Ability to bulk delete terms from network.
	Ajax check/overview of taxonomies/terms in the whole network.
	Networkwide terms sync.
